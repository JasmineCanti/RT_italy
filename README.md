# RT_italy
# RT is an index of contagiosity, is the number of how many people a contagious 
# person could potentially infect. It depends on the effectiveness of the
# social distancing restrictions and is currently used from the government
# to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic. 
# dataset from ISS, date 20 January 2021

# The black line is on the value of contagiosity 1:
# it means that one person could infect one other person on average; 
# a number below one means that the virus is going to disappear
# otherwise the pandemic is spreading exponentially.
